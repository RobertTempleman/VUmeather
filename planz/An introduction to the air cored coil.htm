<h2 id="wht"> What is an air core coil?</h2>
<p>
We'll use the term 'air core coil' to describe an inductor that does not
depend upon a <a href="http://info.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Workshop/advice/coils/mu/index.html#ferro" title="Ferromagnets described"> ferromagnetic material</a> to achieve its
specified <a href="http://info.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Workshop/advice/coils/terms.html#ind" title="Inductance defined"> inductance</a>.  This covers the cases where there
really is just air inside as well as windings upon a different insulator
such as bakelite, glass or PTFE etc.
</p>
 
<p>
[<a href="#top"><big>↑</big> Top</a> of page]
</p>



<h2 id="why"> Do you need an air coil?</h2>
<p>
What are the advantages of an air core coil?  
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Its <a href="http://info.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Workshop/advice/coils/terms.html#ind">inductance</a> is unaffected by the 
	current it carries.  This contrasts with the situation with coils 
	using <a href="http://info.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Workshop/advice/coils/mu/index.html#ferro" title="Ferromagnets described">
	ferromagnetic</a> cores whose inductance 
	tends to reach a peak at moderate <a href="http://info.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Workshop/advice/coils/terms.html#strength"> field 
	strengths</a> before dropping towards zero as <a href="http://info.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Workshop/advice/coils/mu/index.html#sat" title="Saturation described"> 
	saturation</a> approaches.  Sometimes non-linearity in the <a href="http://info.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Workshop/advice/coils/mu/index.html#bhcurve" title="Magnetization curves explained"> 
	magnetization curve</a> can be tolerated; for example in switching
	converters.  In circuits such as audio cross over networks in hi-fi
	speaker systems you must avoid distortion; then you need an air
	coil.  Most radio transmitters rely on air coils to prevent the
	production of harmonics.

    </li><li>Air coils are also free of the <a href="http://info.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Workshop/advice/coils/power_loss.html">'iron losses' </a> which affect ferromagnetic
    cores.  As frequency is increased this advantage becomes
    progressively more important. You obtain better <a href="http://info.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Workshop/advice/coils/power_loss.html#q">Q-factor</a>, greater efficiency, greater
    power handling, and less distortion.

    </li><li>Lastly, air coils can be designed to perform at frequencies
    as high as 1 Ghz.  Most ferromagnetic cores tend to be rather lossy
    above 100 MHz.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
And the 'downside'?
</p>

<ul>
    <li> Without a high permeability core you must have more and/or
    larger turns to achieve a given inductance value.  More turns means
    larger coils, lower <a href="http://info.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Workshop/advice/coils/index.html#self">self-resonance</a> and
    higher <a href="http://info.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Workshop/advice/coils/power_loss.html#copper">copper loss</a>.  At higher
    frequencies you generally don't need high inductance, so this is
    then less of a problem.
	</li><li> 
    Greater stray field radiation and pickup.  With the closed magnetic 
	paths used in cored inductors radiation is much less serious.  As the 
	diameter increases towards a wavelength (lambda = c / f), loss due to 
    electromagnetic radiation will become significant.  <a href="http://info.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Workshop/advice/coils/index.html#bib">Balanis</a> has the gory details.  You may be 
	able to reduce this problem by enclosing the coil in a screen, or by 
	mounting it at right angles to other coils it may be coupling with.
	<p>
	You may be using an air cored coil not because you require a circuit
	element with a specific inductance<i> per se</i> but because your
	coil is used as a proximity sensor, loop antenna, induction heater,
	Tesla coil,  electromagnet,<a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/clarcana/proj/magnetometer/index.html" title="Magnetometer project"> magnetometer head</a> or deflection
	yoke etc.  Then an<a href="#flx"> external field</a> may be what you
	want.

	</li>

<h2 id="slc"> The single layer coil</h2>
<p>
<img src="An%20introduction%20to%20the%20air%20cored%20coil_files/air_coil.gif" class="ralign" alt="An air core coil">
A single layer coil has two advantages.  Firstly, like all air core coils,
it is free from <a href="http://info.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Workshop/advice/coils/power_loss.html">'iron losses'</a>  and the <a href="#why">non-linearity</a> mentioned above.  Secondly, single layer coils have 
the additional advantage of low self-capacitance and thus high <a href="http://info.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Workshop/advice/coils/index.html#self">self-resonant</a> frequency.  These coils are mostly used 
above about 3 Mhz.
</p><p>
In the simple case of 
a single layer solenoidal coil the inductance may be estimated as follows 
(<a href="http://info.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Workshop/advice/coils/index.html#bib" title="Bibliographical reference to Wheeler's formula">Wheeler</a>) -
</p>
<div class="maths">
	<div class="EqnRelation">
		L = 0.001 N<sup>2</sup>r<sup>2</sup> / (228r + 254l) 
	</div>
	<div class="EqnRef"> Equation ACS</div>
</div>
<p>
<br class="lclear">
<br>
where  L is the inductance in henrys, r is the coil radius in metres, l
is the coil length in metres (&gt;0.8r) and N is the number of turns.
</p><p>
This formula applies at 'low' frequencies.  At frequencies high enough for 
<a href="http://info.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Workshop/advice/coils/power_loss.html#skin">skin effect</a> to occur a correction of up to 
about -2% is made.
</p><p>
To construct a self-supporting air cored coil take a length of plain 1 
millimetre diameter copper wire and hold one end in a bench vice.  Take the 
other end in a pair of pliers and pull until the wire has stretched 
slightly - this will straighten it.  Using a 5 millimetre diameter drill 
bit wrap the wire around it until enough turns have been applied.  Using 
'long nosed' pliers bend the ends of the coil to get them into a radial 
position.
</p><p>
Small reductions in the inductance obtained can be achieved by pulling 
the turns apart slightly.  This will also reduce <a href="http://info.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Workshop/advice/coils/index.html#self"> 
self-resonance</a>.  Other combinations of wire and coil diameter may be 
tried but best results are usually obtained when the length of the coil is 
the same as its diameter.
</p><p>
This property also leads to a disadvantage of the air cored coil: 
microphony.  If you need good frequency stability in the presence of 
vibration then wind the coil on a support made from a suitable plastic or 
ceramic former.
</p><p>
Software capable of calculating the inductance of a single layer coil is 
available at <a href="http://www.qsl.net/k6mlo/coilpage.html" title="Inductance software from K6MLO">http://www.qsl.net/k6mlo/coilpage.html</a>

<h2 id="mly"> The multi layer coil</h2>
<p>
Figure 1 below shows a multi layer air cored coil wound on a circular coil 
former or bobbin.
</p><p>
<img src="An%20introduction%20to%20the%20air%20cored%20coil_files/mult_layer_air_coil.png" class="ralign" alt="The dimensions of an air coil.">
</p><p>
This type of winding is very common because it's simple to construct
with a <a href="http://info.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Workshop/advice/coils/winders/index.html" title="Using the TSU winding machine">winding machine</a> and a mandrel. We'll
consider it in some detail.  The first question is this: if you have a
fixed length of wire then what dimensions of the winding give the
greatest <a href="http://info.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Workshop/advice/coils/terms.html#ind"> inductance</a>?  Put another way,
what is the most efficient shape?
</p><p>
The ratio of the winding depth to length, which is c/b, needs to be close
to unity; so the winding should have a square cross section.  This makes
sense because only with the square is the average distance between turns at
a minimum (a circular cross section would be even better, but that is hard
to construct).  Keeping the turns close together maintains a high level of
magnetic coupling ('<a href="http://info.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Workshop/advice/coils/terms.html#link">flux linkages</a>') between
them, and so the general rule that the inductance of a coil increases with
the square of the number of turns is maintained.<br class="ClrImg">
</p><p>
OK, now what about the mean radius of the turns: dimension a ?
<img src="An%20introduction%20to%20the%20air%20cored%20coil_files/Brooks_ratio.png" class="ralign" alt="Optimum shape for a multi layer coil">
</p><p>
In the adjacent Fig. 2 you see three coils in cross section.  Each uses the
same length of wire but the diameter of the coil varies.  The inductance of
any one turn is linearly proportional to its diameter; so you want a large
diameter to get the most inductance.  Also you need all turns in the
winding to be as close as possible to all the others.  The coil on the left
fulfills these requirements, but it has a problem because, in making the
diameter large, you don't have sufficient wire to give it many turns. 
Since the inductance of the winding as a whole varies as the square of the
number of turns the left hand coil won't have high L.
</p><p>
The coil on the right does have a high number of turns, but it isn't
optimum for two reasons.  The diameter of each turn is small (particularly
those near the centre of the coil) which leads to a low inductance per
turn.  Worse, the distance between turns separated by the diagonals of the
winding cross section is large.  This leads to weak coupling between them
(lower <a href="http://info.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Workshop/advice/coils/terms.html#link">flux linkage</a>) and a failure of the
N<sup>2</sup> relationship with coil inductance.
</p><p>
Can you anticipate a punch line?  Brooks, who wrote a paper in 1931, 
calculated that the ideal value for the mean radius is very close to 3c/2. 
We call a coil having these dimensions a <i>Brooks coil</i>.  It's worth 
emphasising that the Brooks ratio is not critical.  You can have a coil which 
deviates from it quite significantly before L falls off very much.
Also, you may have other considerations than the inductance alone.
</p><p>
If we let S<sub>1</sub> = (c/2a)<sup>2</sup> then the inductance, in
henrys, of any of our three coils can be approximated by
</p>
<div class="maths">
	<div class="EqnRelation">
		L = 4×10<sup>-7</sup>πa
		N<sup>2</sup>((0.5+S<sub>1</sub>/12)ln(8/S<sub>1</sub>)
		-0.84834+0.2041S<sub>1</sub>)
	</div>
	<div class="EqnRef"> Equation ACA</div>
</div>
<p>
<br class="clear">
where a is the mean radius of the winding in metres.
</p><p>
Example: If the mean radius is 2.4 cm, the width is 9mm and N is 350 
then L = 6.977 mH.
</p><p>
If we have a proper Brooks coil then the formula above boils down to

<h3 id="wdi"> When the density is important</h3>
<p>
Sometimes the purpose of an air coil is not to possess inductance but to
create a region of space having a definite <a href="http://info.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Workshop/advice/coils/terms.html#fdens" title="Magnetic flux density defined">magnetic flux density</a>.  A well
known example of this is the deflection coils placed around a cathode ray tube 
where the direction of the electron beam is controlled by the current driven 
through the coils.  Outlined below are methods by which you can relate 
the strength of the field to the coil current.  When you know the field 
at all points around a coil then you can also find its inductance.
</p>

<h3 id="bse"> The Biot-Savart equation</h3>
<p>
<img src="An%20introduction%20to%20the%20air%20cored%20coil_files/BiotSavart.png" class="ralign" alt="Fig. FCE: The field due to a current element."> You can see in these
web pages examples of the <a href="http://info.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Workshop/advice/coils/terms.html#strength">duality between
the electric world and the magnetic world</a>.  There is, though, a
fundamental distinction: a point electric charge in a vacuum produces a
symmetrical field whereas a 'point magnetic charge' which we will call a
<i>current element</i> has a direction of flow which leads to an
asymmetry in field distribution along that direction.
</p><p>
An important result of the work carried out by <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/%7Ehistory/Mathematicians/Ampere.html" title="Biography of Andy Ampere">
André Ampère</a> is the equation which 
is refered to as the <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Mathematicians/Biot.html" title="Biography of John Biot"> Biot-Savart</a>. 
This gives the field at any point surrounding a current element. Such an
element should have negligible length, ds, and negligible diameter (see
figure FCE).
<br class="clear">

<p>
<br class="clear">
This shows that the magnitude of the field falls with the square of the
distance, r, from the current element and also with the sine of the angle
, θ, subtended to the current direction.  The direction of the magnetic
field is at a right angle to the current direction and also at a right
angle to the line r.  The 'sense' of the field vector is right handed or
clockwise looking along the direction of current flow.
</p><p>
At any point along the circular field line labeled F in figure FCE a tangent 
to it has a direction fulfilling the requirements just given.  Imagine a 
set of such lines surrounding the current element, spaced in accordance 
with the expression for dB.  Lessen the strain on your imagination by looking 
at a representation of the function <a href="http://info.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Workshop/advice/coils/BSavartField/index.html">
sin(θ)/r<sup>2</sup></a> as an intensity plot. 
</p><p>
You might complain that the Biot-Savart equation doesn't seem to be buying us 
very much: an isolated current element is an imposibility in practice and real 
coils use wires which may be very thick.  What saves the day in the case of air 
coils is the principle of superposition.  Without a ferromagnetic core to spoil 
the linearity of the system we can simply divide the actual current flow up 
into any number of smaller regions and then sum, or integrate, the individual 
fields to obtain the total flux density.
</p>

<h3 id="bsl"> Biot-Savart solves a current loop</h3>
<p>
Let's apply <a href="#bse">Biot-Savart</a> to a single turn circular loop
and derive a formula for the <a href="http://info.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Workshop/advice/coils/terms.html#fdens" title="Magnetic flux density defined">flux density</a> at any point along the
axis. We'll assume that the diameter of the wire is negligible in
comparison with the diameter of the loop - in the terminology this is
known as a <i>current filament</i>.
</p><p>
<img src="An%20introduction%20to%20the%20air%20cored%20coil_files/loop_field.png" class="ralign" alt="The field due to a current loop"> 
In figure FLP we see the loop, of radius a, in cross section and we want
the flux density at the point P<sub>1</sub> on the loop axis at a
distance r from the conductor.  We start by considering the contribution
to the field made by a current element at P<sub>2</sub>.  
The figure shows a P<sub>1</sub> which happens to be quite far from the loop.  
ψ is rather small and the field vector (B<sub>T</sub>, 
shown in blue) is swinging up towards the radial direction. 
You can resolve B<sub>T</sub> into two components: B<sub>R</sub>, shown in red 
and  B<sub>A</sub>, shown in green. We can disregard the radial component, 
B<sub>R</sub>, because of the symmetry of the loop: it is going to be cancelled 
by the field generated by the current element on the opposite side of the loop 
at P<sub>3</sub>.  We are left with just the axial component (that we need to 
find): B<sub>A</sub>.  Its magnitude will be

Clearly, any line (such as r) which joins P<sub>1</sub> to the conductor
will intersect the direction of current flow at a right angle.  This means
that sin(θ) in the Biot-Savart equation will be 1.0.  At points off

Now, all we have here is the field due to the single current element 
at P<sub>2</sub>, but we need the total field due to all the elements around

<h3 id="fsl"> The field in a solenoid</h3>
<p>
It's not too difficult to extend the <a href="#FMC">above result</a> for a
current loop to solve the field at any point on the axis of a solenoidal
coil (shown in cross section in figure FSD).  As usual, I'm going to use a
combination of 'hand waving' arguments and integral calculus.  If you just
want the bottom line then see <a href="#FDS">equation FDS</a>.

First we have to make a simplification because the flux lines will not run
perfectly true along the axis but will spiral slightly around it
(reflecting the helical nature of the coil itself).  This effect becomes
less if the turns are spaced more closely.  In fact this leads on to
the concept of a <i>current sheet</i>.  If we kept the dimensions of the
solenoid the same but used, say, three times the number of turns and at the
same time reduced the current to one third then the overall <a href="http://info.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Workshop/advice/coils/terms.html#mmf" title="Magneto motive force defined">magneto
motive force</a> is the same and so the field produced will be much as
before.
</p><p>
In the limit we no longer worry about the total number of individual
turns and the coil current.  Mentally replace them with a thin walled
copper tube carrying a total current N × I amps flowing around its
circumference and distributed evenly along its length.  Don't ask how
the current gets there; this is pure hypothesis :-) .  Now we can talk
of an <a href="http://info.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Workshop/advice/coils/terms.html#mmf" title="Magneto motive force
defined">mmf</a> per unit length of the tube, F<sub>l</sub> -

Having gone to the trouble of smoothing out the turns into a continuous
current sheet or tube we now proceed to chop it up again!  If we consider
an infinitesimally short length of tube, dz, then we have precisely the
sort of current loop whose axial field we calculated (equation <a href="#FMC" title="The magnetic field of a current loop">FMC</a>) via 
the <a href="#bse" title="The Biot-Savart equation defined">Biot-Savart
